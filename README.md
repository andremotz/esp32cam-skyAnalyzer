## ESP32Cam-skyAnalyzer 
Sketch to detect your sky's color/brightness/snow? with a simple ESP32cam.

* Forked from alanesq/esp32cam-demo.
* See the initial repo for further description. This fork is an adjustment for my needs:
`/getrgbjson` returns the average pixel-color of the camera that my home-automation processes further via Node-RED.
